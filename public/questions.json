    "question": "Tell us something about useFormStatus()",
    "answer": "`useFormStatus()` is a special React hook (mostly used in Next.js App Router) that helps you know if a form is currently submitting. It is useful when you want to show a loading message like “Submitting…” or when you want to disable the submit button while the form is being sent. This improves user experience by preventing multiple clicks and showing feedback. You use it inside a component that is related to a form, like a custom submit button."
